# ForestBeings
Forest Beings project for Ars Electronica Festival, as a collaboration with ASTER+

The program consists of three main parts:
- Generation of background forest sounds
- Generation of AI voice responses
- Control and management of main installation part

Generation of background forest sounds

The composition of these sounds would be done through the training of a GAN model. The database of sounds used would consists of different sounds coming mainly from FreeSound.org (without copyright and creative commons 0 usage permits)

Generation of AI voice responses

Done using CoquiTTS and randomly selection of wording in different AI generated templates. Those templates were generated by DeepSeek AI.

Control and management of main installation part

Consisting mainly of microphone control and queue looping management. Coded in Supercollider.
